     * Create a new channel for sending point-to-point messages.
     * Under RMQ we:
     *     1. Create a socket connection to the broker
     *     2. Create a channel on that socket
     *     3. Create a direct exchange on the server for point-to-point messaging
     *     4. Create a queue to hold messages
     *     5. Bind the queue to listen to a routing key on that exchange
     * We have split producer and consumer, as they need separate serialization/de-serialization of the message
     * We are disposable so that we can be used within a using statement; connections are unmanaged resources and we
     * want to remember to close them.

     * @param messageSerializer A method that serializes a type into JSON
     * @param messageDeserializer A method that deserializes a type from JSON
     * @param routingKey The topic the queue we are using subscribes to (same name mirrors P2P)
     * @param hostName The name of the host (i.e. localhost)
